# reward_np_analysis
###analysis of multi-session reward project

this is the analysis repo of a set of fMRI experiments, in which the influence of reward on visual cortex is examined. Data are stored in a BIDS-compatible fashion, to be uploaded to openfMRI.org, and are preprocessed with a nipype workflow. 

Further analyses will focus BOLD time-course estimation, connectivity analyses between BOLD and pupil, etc.

## Prerequisites:

Python packages:
nipype, spynoza, fir, hedfpy, sklearn, numpy, scipy, matplotlib.
